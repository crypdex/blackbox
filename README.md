# BlackboxOS

The BlackboxOS is a pluggable platform for deploying multi-chain applications. It is used as the basis for all [Crypdex's](https://crypdex.io) Blackbox devices. Basic info and getting started stuff is on this page. Deeper dive documentation is currently accruing on the [Wiki](https://github.com/crypdex/blackbox/wiki).

## Why BlackboxOS?

The BlackboxOS builds on Docker container and orchestration tooling to address the specific needs of running blockchain-centric networks including security, data management, and inter-process communication.

**ðŸ‘¾Multiarch All The Things!**

Deploy stacks on arm64 or x86 chipsets. Or both!

**ðŸŽ—Support and Maintenance**

Service definitions, recipes, and images are maintained and kept up-to-date ensuring that your project is always running the right fork.

## What sort of stuff can you do?

Here are a few examples of what you can do with the BlackboxOS.

- **SeedBox**: Create a device that keeps fresh copies of multiple blockchains always up to date.
- **Staking Node**: Crypdex uses the BlackboxOS to configure, run, and maintain it's [PIVX Staking Node](https://crypdex.io/products/pivx-node).

There are some preconfigured recipes in the [`/recipes`](https://github.com/crypdex/blackbox/tree/master/recipes) directory.

## Features

- Portable, Docker-based services
- Multiarch support: Runs on x86_64 and arm64 devices
- Optimized for multiple full nodes
- Unified multi-chain deterministic wallet available
- Expandable with new chains. Dynamically.
- Accessible via CLI, HTTP API, native RPCs, and GUI (under development)

# Getting Started

A CLI mediates all interaction with the BlackboxOS.

### Get started in 3 easy steps

0. Download a [release](https://github.com/crypdex/blackbox/releases) for your platform. There is an `apt` repo available soon for Debian variants.
1. Initialize your system with a recipe

```shell
$ blackbox init -r crypdex/pivx-stakebox
```

2. Start er up

```shell
$ blackbox start
```

3. Profit! ðŸŽ‰

Configuration is kept in a `yaml` config file that you might want to edit.

## System Requirements

- Docker

BlackboxOS makes some assumptions about your deployment environment.

- The device is running a single node (no clustering yet) and can monopolize resources.
- It's Linux or macOS.

## Hardware Requirements

The BlackboxOS currently supports `arm64v8` and `x86_64` architectures so assuming you have enough RAM, CPU, and disc space to accomidate all the services you want to run, it should work on everything from a RaspberryPi 3 or Odroid C2 to an Intel NUC or cloud image.

Here are some suggestions

- **\>= 2GB RAM**. You can get away with 1GB RAM with swap enabled, but its gonna be a little slow. You may want to add swap anyway when running on a SBC.
- **\>= 64GB disc space**. Probably less than 1TB. Depends on your chain(s)
- `x86_64` or `arm64v8` chipsets.

Volume space requirements are entirely dependent on which services you are running. Chains like PIVX on the smaller end consume about 18GB of space while Bitcoin needs upwards of 250GB. This of course changes gradually to the upside.

We have had great success with Odroid C2's and Intel NUC. We have found the RaspberryPi to have insufficient RAM. The CPU clock speed is almost never the bottleneck and even the cheapest lowest-end SBC's now have quad-core configurations.

## Data Management Strategies

Managing blockchain data is one of the biggest pain points in working with multi-chain applications. The need for data management strategies becomes even more accute when using SD cards whose R/W speeds are typically pretty bad (though this is likely to improve very soon).

The BlackboxOS assumes that a data volume is mounted for each service. For the moment, this is in a common place, but work is being done on configuration per service if desired. This gives developers the option to "pre-seed" chains by downloading the chain elsewhere and copying the entire directory over to the device running the BlackboxOS.

This strategy is what Crypdex uses. We run a SeedBox that keeps fresh copies of each chain we support (configured with BlackboxOS of course), so that we can copy it to our other projects.

## Supported Services

While you are free to add your own services to the BlackboxOS, the following are maintained and supported by Crypdex. Because this project is under active development, the following table can give you some idea if whats up.

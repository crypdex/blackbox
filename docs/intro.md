**BlackboxOS** is a pluggable platform for deploying multi-chain applications. It is used as the basis for all Crypdex's Blackbox devices.

There are a few things that we think makes it particularly useful:

- It takes an ARM-first approach to its services. Service stacks should run reliably on both single board computers (like the RPi) as well as in the cloud.
- Built-in data management strategy. Sync your chain on super-fast machines and copy to your embedded device.
- Image maintenance. We make sure that blockchain images are updated to keep you on the right fork.
- It's really just Docker. Add your own services and images to customize your deployment.

Ready to give it a go? Great. Let's proceed.

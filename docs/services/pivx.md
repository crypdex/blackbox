From the PIVX [Github repo](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX)

> PIVX is an open source crypto-currency focused on fast private transactions using the Zerocoin protocol, with low transaction fees & environmental footprint. It utilizes the first ever anonymous proof of stake protocol, called zPoS, combined with regular PoS and masternodes for securing its network.

## Usage

To use the PIVX service, configure your `blackbox.yml` file as follows:

```yaml
version: "3.7"

services:
  pivx:
```

## Environment Variables

When using the service, these environment variables are generated by `blackboxd` with reasonable defaults. You may override them in your shell or `.env` file.

```.env
PIVX_DATA_DIR=${DATA_DIR}/pivx
PIVX_VERSION=
```

## Port Mappings

| Open Port | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- |
| `51472`   | P2P     |
| `51473`   | RPC     |

By default, these ports are exposed. To close them, add the `ports` key to the config file and lock the exposure to "localhost".

```yaml
version: "3.7"

services:
  pivx:
    ports:
      - 127.0.0.1:51472:51472
      - 127.0.0.1:51473:51473
```

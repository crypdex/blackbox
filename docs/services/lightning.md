From the LND [docs](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd)

> The Lightning Network Daemon (lnd) - is a complete implementation of a Lightning Network node. lnd has several pluggable back-end chain services including btcd (a full-node), bitcoind, and neutrino (a new experimental light client). The project's codebase uses the btcsuite set of Bitcoin libraries, and also exports a large set of isolated re-usable Lightning Network related libraries within it

## Usage


To use the recipe, configure your `blackbox.yml` file as follows:

```yaml
version: "3.7"

services: 
  lightning_bitcoin:
```



## Environment Variables

When using the service, these environment variables are generated by `blackboxd` with reasonable defaults. You may override them in your shell or `.env` file.

```.env


```

You may `export` these in the shell before startup, or put them in a `.env` file at the root of the blackbox dir.

## Ports

See the [Decred docs](https://docs.decred.org/faq/configuration/) for more information.

### dcrd

|              | Mainnet | Testnet | Simnet |
| ------------ | ------- | ------- | ------ |
| Peer to Peer | 9108    | 19108   | 18555  |
| RPC Server   | 9109    | 19109   | 19556  |

### dcrwallet

|          | Mainnet | Testnet | Simnet |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------ |
| JSON-RPC | 9110    | 19110   | 19557  |
| gRPC     | 9111    | 19111   | 19558  |

By default, these ports are not exposed. To open them, add the `ports` key to the config file.

```yaml
version: "3.7"

services:
  pivx:
    ports:
      - 9108:9108
      ...
```

## TLS Certs

Decred is pretty serious about security and verification in its communications. As such, it uses TLS certs for its RPC connections. The daemons generate their own certs if left alone, but the daemon generated certs are not compatible with this Docker network. This is due to the way that the domains are registered in the cert.

This project generates certs that can be used to get Decred working in its default case. This happens at service boot (see the prestart script). If you would like to heighten your own security, you may generate new certs manually.

[This article](https://stakey.club/en/digital-certificates-for-rpc-connections/) gives a nice tutorial.

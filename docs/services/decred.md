From the Decred [docs](https://docs.decred.org/)

> Decred (/ˈdi:ˈkred/, /dɪˈkred/, dee-cred) is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency with a strong focus on community input, open governance, and sustainable funding for development. It utilizes a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mining system to ensure that a small group cannot dominate the flow of transactions or make changes to Decred without the input of the community. A unit of the currency is called a decred (DCR).

## Usage

The `decred` service is composed of 2 individual services: `dcrd` and `dcrwallet`. These sub-services are not currently separable from the main `decred` service since they function together.

To use the recipe, configure your `blackbox.yml` file as follows:

```yaml
version: "3.7"

services: 
  decred:
```

> This service requires manual setup

Once you have specified the `decred` recipe, run `blackboxd start` and follow the prompts to initialize your wallet.
After this is done, you should be able to reliably boot `blackboxd` unattended.

## Environment Variables

When using the service, these environment variables are generated by `blackboxd` with reasonable defaults. You may override them in your shell or `.env` file.

```.env
DECRED_DATA_DIR=${DATA_DIR}/decred
# The following environment variable should be set for unattended operation.
DECRED_WALLET_PASSWORD=youshouldsetthis
```

You may `export` these in the shell before startup, or put them in a `.env` file at the root of the blackbox dir.

## Ports

See the [Decred docs](https://docs.decred.org/faq/configuration/) for more information.

### dcrd

https://docs.decred.org/wallets/cli/dcrd-and-dcrwallet-cli-arguments/

|              | Mainnet | Testnet | Simnet |
| ------------ | ------- | ------- | ------ |
| Peer to Peer | 9108    | 19108   | 18555  |
| RPC Server   | 9109    | 19109   | 19556  |

### dcrwallet

|          | Mainnet | Testnet | Simnet |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------ |
| JSON-RPC | 9110    | 19110   | 19557  |
| gRPC     | 9111    | 19111   | 19558  |

By default, these ports are not exposed. To open them, add the `ports` key to the config file.

```yaml
version: "3.7"

services:
  pivx:
    ports:
      - 9108:9108
      ...
```

## TLS Certs

Decred is pretty serious about security and verification in its communications. As such, it uses TLS certs for its RPC connections. The daemons generate their own certs if left alone, but the daemon generated certs are not compatible with this Docker network. This is due to the way that the domains are registered in the cert.

This project generates certs that can be used to get Decred working in its default case. This happens at service boot (see the prestart script). If you would like to heighten your own security, you may generate new certs manually.
